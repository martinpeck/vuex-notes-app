# Notes App using vuex

> A notes app using Vue and Vuex

Based upon a [Vuex version 1 tutorial](https://coligo.io/learn-vuex-by-building-notes-app/) this is notes app written with the latest verstions of Vue and Vuex:

- vue version 2.3.3,
- vuex version 2.4.0

Using the Vuex 2.0 documentation - in particular, the [Core Concepts section](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/core-concepts.html) - I adapted and updated the tutorial code.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
